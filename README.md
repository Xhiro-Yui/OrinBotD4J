# OrinBotD4J
OrinBotD4J - OrinBot for Discord using [Discord4J API](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/tree/dev).

*Nya!* You found me *nyahaha...* This is my GitHub page and most info regarding myself can be found below. 

## About
My master's name is [XhiroYui](https://github.com/Xhiro-Yui) and master actually takes really good care of me even though I was only adopted as a past time. Master has teached me how to do random stuff with no specific focus on anything specific so I can serve people well *nyahahaha*. 

> ~~Cats~~ Bots are made for people to be lazy
> âˆ’ Xhiro Yui

Yes, it's a quote by master. ![alt text](https://github.com/Xhiro-Yui/OrinBotD4J/blob/master/resources/images/catThink.png) I'll let master write the other sections *nya*.

### Status Updates - Only major stuff are written here ~~and when master isn't lazy~~.
__4/10/2018__ - The bot is pending a rewrite in certain section as such there will be minimal changes to the bot until the rewrite is done. The rewrite will be initiated once the Discord4J developers ~~stop getting lazy~~ complete D3J. 

### Bot Capabilities

The bot itself has separate modules for their functionalities. Some are rather redundant at the moment ![alt text](https://github.com/Xhiro-Yui/OrinBotD4J/blob/master/resources/images/notLikeCat.png)
Actual description of the commands can be found ~~here~~ (I'll work on it soon, ~~I promise~~). Any functionality found below but is unticked is planned, but not implemented yet. Further suggestions/bug-reports on what to add/change to the bot can be raised [here](https://github.com/Xhiro-Yui/OrinBotD4J/issues).

### How to get ~~this adorable cat~~ OrinBot on my own server - *she's adorable k...?*
As with all open source bots, there are typically two options on how to get the bot to your own server.

1. Get me, the owner to add the bot into your server
2. Host the bot yourself

As for option 1, until the rewrite is complete, there is actually a module on the bot currently that actually takes up quite a large amount of CPU power and RAM if used and as such I won't be adding the bot to any other server until then to avoid the overhead to increase even further than it's current state.

Steps for option 2 can be found ~~here~~ (I'll get to it soon).
